The Pharmacist Care Plan standardizes the information gathered and developed through the process of medication planning and management in community, hospital, and long term post-acute care (LTPAC) settings. It allows exchange of information between providers of care to optimize medication-related decision support and patient adherence to medication regimens both within a healthcare setting and when a patient moves between healthcare settings.
Standardization of information used in this form will promote interoperability; support a comprehensive, multi-discipline longitudinal care plan; and create information suitable for reuse in quality measurement, public health reporting, research, and for reimbursement.
In assessment of and consultation with the patient, the Pharmacist Care Plan focuses on:

* 	Maximizing the effectiveness of medications ordered and currently used
* 	Identifying and addressing barriers to successful implementation of the therapy regimen
* 	Assuring patient understanding of the reasons for and use of the medication and the goals of therapy
* 	Resolving conflicting orders and plans

These activities help the patient achieve the best possible outcomes of treatment and an enhanced sense of wellbeing.
