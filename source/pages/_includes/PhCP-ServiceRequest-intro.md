This profile represents any of a number of planned interventions for the patient. For example, an activity such as "elevate head of bed" combined with "provide humidified O2 per nasal cannula" may be the interventions performed for a health concern of "respiratory insufficiency" to achieve a goal of "pulse oximetry greater than 92%". These intervention activities may be newly described or derived from a variety of sources within an EHR. Interventions are actions taken to increase the likelihood of achieving the patient's or providers' goals.
